    <h3 style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Inconsolata', monospace;padding-top:12px;" >-what's a website?</h3>
    
    <p style="margin-left:40px">A website (also written as web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Notable examples are wikipedia.org, google.com, and amazon.com.

All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web. There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private network, such as a company's internal website for its employees.

Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or social networking. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page.

Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The software application used on these devices is called a web browser.
</p>
<h3  Style="text-align:center;font-family: 'Inconsolata', monospace;">-how can I create one?</h3>
<p style="margin-left:40px">
Several steps must be followed to create a new website and ensure its success. According to ThoughtCo, these steps are summarized as follows: [4] <b>Website hosting </b>: In this step, a place is rented to contain the website files. 
<br/>
<b>Registering a domain name (Domain name) for the website</b>: where a domain name is purchased for the website, which is the address that is entered in a web browser to access the website.
<br/>
<b>Website planning</b>: These steps include determining the type of website, in addition to its appearance and content.
<br/>
<b>Website design</b>: This step is the most complicated among the others; For those who want to design a site must be a scientist in a few things, such as design basics, knowledge of the languages ​​used in the design, and so on. <br/>
<b>Publish the website</b>: In this step, the website files are uploaded to the website host. <br/>
<b>Promote and market the site</b>: to increase the number of its visitors.
<br/>
 <b>Regular maintenance of the website</b>: The website must be maintained and updated if necessary.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;font-family: 'Inconsolata', monospace;">what's web hosting?</h3>
<img src="/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshots/hosting.png" width="300px" height="100px" style="margin-left:30px;">
<p style="margin-left:40px">
Website hosting is the process by which a dedicated place on the web is rented to contain the files and resources needed for the website, and these files are contained in a web server so that any visitor can access them. Website hosting prices vary according to the host and the features and services provided by it, and several types of web hosting services are available; To suit the size of the website, and among these services are the following: <br/> <b>Shared web hosting service</b>: In this type of hosting service, the resources are shared with other subscribers on a server with high specifications, the website performance may be affected in the event of pressure on the server caused by other sites. The cost of this type of hosting services is usually very low, and this type is suitable for small websites that are not expected to receive a large number of visitors at the same time.<br/>
 <b>Reseller web hosting service </b>: This hosting service is very similar to shared hosting service, except that it is equipped with a number of tools that allow the subscriber to resell the space that he rents, and if this is not the subscriber's goal, then the resort is not preferred To this type of hosting service. <br/>
<b>Cloud based web hosting service </b>: This service relies on cloud technology to run websites, as hundreds of distributed computers work together as one huge computer server with super specifications. This type of hosting service differs from the shared hosting service, in that it is able to withstand major pressures on websites without the need to close them, and this service depends on the principle of paying for the volume of use only.<br/> <b>Virtual Private Server ( VPS)</b>: The virtual private server is like an independent computer device, but it reserves its own resources by an independent server, as this independent server contains a number of virtual servers, each of which has its own resources, and in this way One website is not affected by another website even if they are on the same device. The prices of this type of hosting services range from 50-200 dollars depending on the capacity of the central processing unit (CPU), in addition to the capacity of the random access memory (RAM) selected. <br/>
<b>Dedicated Server</b>: A computer is rented from the hosting company. So that the subscriber enjoys all of his resources without sharing them with any other site. Prices for dedicated servers start at $ 100, and the cost of hiring a system administrator may be added to this if the site owner wants to hire him to handle the server's technical tasks. It is preferable to resort to this type of hosting service when receiving a large number of visitors.
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Domain name registration</b><br/>
 The domain name that the website owner wants to use for visitors to enter the site is purchased, and the domain name purchase prices range between $ 8-35 annually, and it is purchased from one of the sites that specialize in selling it, and some hosting companies may also provide domain names if The subscriber wanted to purchase it, and this facilitates the process of managing the site so that the hosting service in addition to the domain name are on the same account.<br/>

   The website must be planned before starting its design, so its type is determined, which in turn affects the design process later on, and how the visitor's movement within the site is determined by creating a site map (in English: Site map), which clarifies the structure of the site and its pages, in addition to the links that it contains. Also, during the website planning stage, the website content is determined from text, images, video clips, and more.<br/>
    <b> Website design</b> <br/>The website is designed using one of the well-known web design methods, it can be programmed using site building languages ​​such as HTML (English: HTML), Stacked Style Pages (English: CSS), in addition to JavaScript (English: Javascript), and as a method. Other, you can resort to a website design software, or content management software (CMS) that facilitate the design process. <br/>
    <b> Publish the website</b><br/> Website files are uploaded to the hosting service through one of the tools that the service itself may provide for this, or by file transfer protocol (FTP), which is supported by most hosting services.<br/>
   <b>Website marketing</b></br> The website should be marketed in the event that the owner wants to advertise it and increase the number of its visitors, and one of the beneficial ways in that is to resort to improving search engines (SEO) so that people looking for products or services offered by the website can easily find it through search engines. Website designers may have to make some adjustments to support different search engines, and other means of marketing websites include e- mail or social media , or it can be done by simply announcing them by known means.<br/> 
   <b> Website maintenance</b><br/> The website must be checked before publication, and after that it is checked on an ongoing basis. To ensure that it remains working as required, it can also be updated to keep pace with the latest developments, such as: support for modern devices, in addition to various web browsers, and it is preferable to add more content to the site constantly in proportion to its audience.
